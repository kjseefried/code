This extension expands Flare's functionality outside of that provided by the web server
Jobs allows Flare to run commands using elevated privileges (root) on the server.

At Tech we used this feature to add system accounts for the following services that
we provided to the students

- FTP
- Samba
- MySQL
- Subversion

We also used this extension to act as a web-cron daemon. This allowed us to schedule
scripts and other items to be run by using the web front-end.

To install this extension, you must do one extra step outside of clicking the 'install'
button in the Settings extension.

A script comes with this extension called 'flarecmd'. You must place an entry for this
script in root's (or an account with privileges meeting your personal requirements) crontab
file. The following line in your crontab can be used.

*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/flarecmd --flaredir=/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/flare/ >/dev/null 2>&1

Replace the path to flarecmd and the path to your Flare installation with your own locations
This cron entry will run the flarecmd script every 5 minutes.

flarecmd is written so that if another instance of itself is still running after the 5 minutes
ends, it will not start another copy of flarecmd. It uses a lockfile in the /tmp folder to accomplish
this.
