    <h3>Usage Policy</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><span style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;'>Media (software, music, movies, etc) Piracy Policy</span><p />
    Flare and FUEL follow a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>ZERO TOLERANCE</span> policy for Media Piracy. FUEL is offered as a service
    run by the ACM and Open Source Committee. Since we are campus organizations, we must adhere to (at least)
    the Indiana Tech policy for Media Piracy. We have decided to take the policy a step further though.
    <p />
    FUEL offers a gigabyte of free file storage and webspace to its users. The inherent danger in this is
    that students may decide to use their space for sharing illegal content (as defined by Indiana Tech).
    Because of this, if your account is found to be holding content deemed illegal, your account
    will be immediatly deactivated. Once processing of the content in your filespace is finished, actions will
    be taken in accordance with campus policy. Only after this will you be eligible to receive another account.
    The content stored in your previous account however will have been permanently erased.

    <li><span style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;'>Virus Policy</span><p />
    Flare routinely scans it's disk storage for files that may contain viruses.
    Flare follows a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>THREE(3) STRIKES</span> policy for virus
    uploads. On each instance that your account has reportedly uploaded a virus to our system, your
    account will be marked, and you will be sent an email.
    <p />
    The uploaded file will immediatly be removed from the system, so as to not facilitate sharing or downloading
    of this file.
    <p />
    After your third strike, your account will be disabled. You will need to make contact with a system 
    administrator to re-enable your account. Disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with campus policy.

    <li><span style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;'>Spamming Policy</span><p />
    Several features on Flare may have the ability to be used as a means of spamming other user's accounts.
    If your account is reported, or flagged by the system as exhibiting
    user spamming activity, your account will be disabled and you will need to contact a Flare or FUEL 
    system administrator to reactivate your account. Disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with campus 
    policy.

    <li><span style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;'>Programming Policy</span><p />
    Flare provides a web front end to the storage space supplied by FUEL. As a user of both the Flare and FUEL
    systems, you are allowed to post code written by you or others to the web. Several restrictions apply however,
    see below.
    <p />
    <ol>
        <li>Your account will be suspended permanently if any Flare or FUEL services are taken offline on account
            of any code that has been posted to your webspace. Your account can only be re-enabled after being approved
            by a Flare or FUEL admin.
        <li>No Perl. It's not gonna happen, dont ask
        <li>No system level commands allowed. If you use them, we will know you did. We log this kind of stuff people.
    </ol>
    </ol>
    <div style='text-align: center;'>
        Flare takes a very simple approach towards usage of our systems.<p />
        <h3>Abuse it and lose it</h3><p />
        We won't tolerate students that abuse the services we provide for <span style='font-weight: bold;'>free</span>.<p />
        If you break the rules, you will lose your account, no questions asked, and no, you will not be able to get another one.
