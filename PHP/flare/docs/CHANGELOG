- 07.27.2005 (0.9.0-807 alpha)
	- We're almost to stable. I wont release a 1.0 stable (no matter how many commits we have) until
	  I am sure that we are actually stable. Highlights for this release include.
	- Heavy work put into the admin interface. Everything should work in it.
	- More heavy work and bugfixes on the user side of the interface.
	- Edit user group should be functional, although it isnt 100%
	- I was going initially for HTML 4.01 Transitional W3C validation, but decided to go a step
	  further and just make the whole thing HTML 4.01 Strict. Flare is 100% HTML 4.01 Strict compliant.
	- Removed a lot of account options. It was agreed upon that many of the items available in the
	  users account entry in the database, just did not relate to any core area of Flare. Thus, those
	  database fields were removed. They can always be re-added through extensions that want to make
	  use of them.
	- New Feature: Archive Extract
	- New Feature: Create Archive (actually works almost 100% now)
	- To maintain the users website link, a new entry was added to flare_config that includes
	  the base_url that you want all user websites to use. Flare will replace {USERNAME} with the
	  current user who is surfing around.
	- Moving files works 100%
	- Copying files works 100%
	- New Feature: Rename items
	- Stored, hashed password was removed from session vars. Why did I have this there to begin with?
	- New Feature: Group Quotas - this is still not fully implemented but it's getting there and the
	  base code is in place.
	- New Feature: Trusted and Distribution groups - Because we couldnt decide on a good way to deal
	  with permissions, we're leaving it up to the operating system. Trusted groups allow any group
	  member to write to the group directory. Distribution groups allow only the group admin to write
	  to the group. We'll take care of figuring out who's in which groups and who the admins are, but
	  the community will need to script how they deal with file permissions at the filesystem level.
	- Logging has been greatly enhanced, and is actually in most of the code where necessary.
	- Fixed a bug in the admin.php page for the main site. It will now redirect the user to index.php
	  if they fail to authenticate, and from there they will be shown the login screen.
	- Lots of new template files added to take care of new items in admin area and in the general app
	- All core CSS was validated
	- For our next release, we will fully transition all hard coded text to our lang files. There
	  are plans too to also perhaps provide a lang file feature in the extensions so that they dont
	  need to put their constants into the core Flare lang file. I am also hoping to start add some
	  reports to the brand new reporting system. Getting close to back to school time so stability
	  and bug fixing will be top priority. Also, I have it on my list to upgrade the install scripts.
	  Thanks for reading.

- 11.14.2005 (0.9.0-967 alpha)
	- School is really taking it out of me. Here's the most recent updates that have gone into Flare.
	- Added a permissions system to the Filesystem extension. This completely replaces the bogus
	  immutable dirs feature that we had previously had. This system scales MUCH better than immutable
	  dirs and gives the admin much finer grained control over permissions. It also has some big
	  drawbacks if we arent careful, but we are testing extensively so hopefully it shouldnt be a
	  problem.
	- Added a quotas feature. This was a huge request from the Open Source Committee. We needed this
	  bad or else our job of retricting available space for users was toast. The quotas system does
	  not have an interface yet for adjusting quotas or even setting them during Account creation.
	  I'm working on those parts though so they should go in to SVN in the near future.
	- Fixed a lot of bugs in all extensions.
	- Flare's entire API in all extensions is now documented and PHPDocumentor has been run on it. The
	  results can be seen here. https://flare.indianatech.net/flaredoc/
	- Matt Emborsky has been a big help in providing code for the Maintenance extension. So far he's
	  contributed an 'optimize tables' task, and he is currently working on a permissions task. Thanks!
	- Added a 'used quota/total quotas' display to the MyFiles page
	- Added a new, better, means of authentication to Windows Active Directory using the great PHP class
	  adLDAP. http://adldap.sourceforge.net/ It is highly recommended that if you're using AD authentication
	  that you now use this form instead of kerberos. Kerberos we realize can have massive problems
	  when it comes to authenticating you if your system clock and the domain controllers system clock
	  become skewed. With adLDAP you dont have that problem.
	- Added ability for the user to be able to mark their account as publically viewable or not. This will
	  effect if they can join groups or not.
	- Dropped 2 fields from the accounts database that had to do with user and group directories. Now
	  just a single field, one for user home and one for group home, are provided.
	- Added placeholder for future ClamAV scanning extension
	- Added a javascript character counter to the Add Group page
	- Tim was voted monkey most likely to buy a 10 gallon hat and dance around it.
	- Most likely a helluva lot more. It feels like an incredible amount of work has gone into this
	  update.
