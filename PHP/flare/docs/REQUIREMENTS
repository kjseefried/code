This version of Flare has successfully been tested and installed on systems supporting
the following architecture.

This is a list of the software that you must have installed prior to installing
Flare. If you are missing any of the items below, proper operation of Flare
cannot be guaranteed.

- PHP
	Flare was written soley for PHP5 and will therefore NOT work on PHP versions less than 5.

	Flare has been tested on the following PHP versions
		- 5.0.2
		- 5.0.3
		- 5.0.5

- MySQL
	Flare has been tested on the following MySQL versions
		- 4.1
		- 5.0.18

- Linux Operating system
  Flare was written on linux and has only been tested so far on linux.
  There are several features implemented on Flare that are completely dependant
  on the underlying operating system. As such, the Flare development team encourages
  you to use a linux variant to support Flare. There is no current or planned support
  for Windows.

  Flare has been tested on the following platforms
  	- Debian Sarge 3.1
	- Fedora Core 2
	- Ubuntu Breezy Badger

- Supported Browser
  IE is certainly supported, but the lack of accurate CSS handling by IE makes viewing
  Flare pages less than inviting. The Flare development team strongly recommends that
  all Flare users use a current web browser such as Firefox. IE lacks many of the capabilities
  of modern browsers, and is therefore not a concern of the Flare development team.

  	- Firefox 1.0.3		Works
