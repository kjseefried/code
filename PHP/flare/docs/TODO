This is an INCOMPLETE (obviously) list of the current things todo for the Flare project. If you are interested
in developing for this project, contact Tim Rupp at TARupp01@indianatech.net and let him know you are interested.

- Short Term
	- Multi-language (ask foreign students on campus)
	- Diagrams outlining application data flow and framework
	- Full input validation
	- Incentives barebones system
	- Ideas for incentives to offer
	- Migrate Smarty config file to Flare config file
	- Finish adding the setting to each extension to 'hide extension'
	- Convert language constants to template variables
	- Fixed the group settings page. I know there must be at least one setting in existance for it
	- Add code to purge accounts from system (use Jobs extension to run stuff from cron)
	- Change adLDAP to use $cfg variable and add domain variable to config table for auth extension
	- Implement this in denyhosts report
		How can I prevent a legitimate IP address from being blocked by DenyHosts?

		Since it is quite possible for a user to mistype their password repeatedly
		it may be desirable to have DenyHosts prevent specific IP addresses from being
		added to /etc/hosts.deny. To address this issue, create a file named allowed-hosts
		in the WORK_DIR. Simply add an IP address, one per line. Any IP address that
		appears in this file will not be blocked. 

		Additionally, as of v1.0.3, a valid hostname can also be placed in the allowed-hosts
		file. For each hostname appearing in this file, the IP address will be resolved and
		any ssh connections that match either this hostname or this resolved IP address will
		not be blocked. # this is a comment line

		# the following line prevents DenyHosts from blocking IP address 1.1.1.1
		1.1.1.1
		# The following lines prevent IP addresses 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3 from being blocked
		1.1.1.2
		1.1.1.3
		# 
		# The first 3 parts of the IP address must be provided (eg. 1.2.3.)
		# The last part of the IP address can be a wildcard.
		# The wildcard can be given with an asterisk -or- as a range.
		# 
		# This line prevents all IP address in the 1.1.1 network from being blocked
		# 1.1.1.* 
		# 
		# This line prevents IP addresses in the range 1.1.1.6 to 1.1.1.23 from being blocked
		# 1.1.1.[6-23]
		# the following line prevents DenyHosts from blocking the host foo
		foo

- Long Term
	- Advanced, final p2p interface
	- Stable versions of all database abstraction layers
	- Different template themes
	- Online help system
	- WebDAV support
	- Calendar System
	- ChitChat Group message boards
	- Most likely a helluva lot more
