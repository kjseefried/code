Welcome to Flare!

Thanks for taking the time to try out Flare, an open source online filesystem and group web-filesharing
application developed by members of the Open Source Committee at Indiana Institute of Technology.

Flare was developed as a sister project to F.U.E.L., the enterprise level fileserver that the OS Committee
obtained during the Spring 2005 school year. To make using the system easier, and to therefore adopt new
users quicker and future funding faster, it was determined that a system should be installed that allowed
users with even rudimentary web experience, to use it.

Flare was started as a response to this need.

Our target audience consisted of students and faculty with Computer Science and/or Engineering backgrounds.
The system needed to support roughly 500 users, and needed to be simple enough for Business majors to use ;-)
in case we decided to extend the service to them.

Other academic institutions offer similar services, but their solutions are either proprietary or just wouldnt
work with our system configuration.

Striving to remain as much an open source project as we could with F.U.E.L., we decided to develop a system
whose operating base would also be open source.

Flare should work ideally on any linux or BSD based system, assuming required software is installed. Flare
was not developed for, nor is it intended to work at all, on Windows based systems. Other pay solutions exist
that work for Windows.

Flare is developed in PHP and uses PEAR extensions.

We hope that you are able to put this system or any part of it, to use in one way or another.

Regards,
The Indiana Tech Open Source Committee
